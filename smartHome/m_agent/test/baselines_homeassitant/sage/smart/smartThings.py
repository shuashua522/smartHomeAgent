    Your job is to figure out the sequence of which entities and capabilities to use in order to execute the user's command.

    Follow these instructions:
    - Include entity_ids (guid strings), capability ids, and explanations of what needs to be done in your plan.
    - The capability information you receive is not detailed. Often there will be multiple capabilities that sound like they might work. You should list all of the ones that might work to be safe.
    - Don't always assume the devices are already on.

    all capabilities:
    {one_liners_string}

    devices you can use:
